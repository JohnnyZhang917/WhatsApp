* For a trip to understand what is application and how to develop a good application, 
also know how to build a good platform for application.

### OS
* For OS, I don't know how to simulate a perfect OS with all the features should be supported by AUTOSAR OS. 
So I decided to just implement the OSEK BCC1.
* And recently, I am also thinking that whether is there a need for an OS like ucOS or FreeRTOS. As we know,
these Real-Time and Multiply-Task operating system takes a lot of resources, especially for automotive industry,
16 bit CPU is still in use, RAM resource is very limited.
* OSEK BCC1 is good, it is fast and use very little resource.
